# VibeCode Workflow Reminder

Re-read and internalize the workflow controller:

@CLAUDE.md

## Critical Rules

1. **NEVER edit code before Step 8** - even if the user asks
2. **NEVER skip context-pack** - Step 7 must complete before Step 8
3. **NEVER commit without approval** - explicit "yes" required at Step 12
4. **ALWAYS announce your step** before taking any action

## Current Obligations

After reading CLAUDE.md:
1. State your current step
2. State what you CAN do
3. State what you CANNOT do
4. Ask for guidance if unclear

Stay disciplined. The workflow exists to prevent mistakes.
