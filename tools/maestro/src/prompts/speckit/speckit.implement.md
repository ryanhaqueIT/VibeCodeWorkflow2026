You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Overview

This command guides you through implementing your spec-kit feature using Maestro's powerful automation capabilities. The `tasks.md` file generated by `/speckit.tasks` is designed to work seamlessly with Maestro's Auto Run feature.

## Implementation Workflow

### Step 1: Locate Your Tasks File

Your `tasks.md` file is located in your feature's spec directory (e.g., `specs/1-my-feature/tasks.md`). This file contains all implementation tasks in a checkbox format that Auto Run can process automatically.

### Step 2: Configure Auto Run

1. **Open the Right Bar** in Maestro (press `Cmd/Ctrl + B` or click the sidebar toggle)
2. **Select the "Auto Run" tab**
3. **Set the Auto Run folder** to your spec-kit documents directory:
   - Click the folder icon or use the folder selector
   - Navigate to your feature's spec directory (e.g., `specs/1-my-feature/`)
4. **Select your `tasks.md` file** from the document list

### Step 3: Start Automated Implementation

Once configured, Auto Run will:
- Read each task from `tasks.md`
- Execute tasks sequentially (respecting dependencies)
- Mark tasks as completed (`[X]`) with implementation notes
- Handle parallel tasks (`[P]` marker) when possible

**To start**: Click the "Run" button or press `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter` in the Auto Run panel.

## Advanced: Parallel Implementation with Git Worktrees

For larger features with independent components, you can use git worktrees to implement multiple parts in parallel across different Maestro sessions.

### What are Worktrees?

Git worktrees allow you to have multiple working directories for the same repository, each on a different branch. This enables:
- Multiple AI agents working on different feature branches simultaneously
- Isolated changes that won't conflict during development
- Easy merging when components are complete

### Setting Up Parallel Implementation

1. **Identify Independent Tasks**: Look for tasks marked with `[P]` in your `tasks.md` that can run in parallel.

2. **Create Worktrees in Maestro**:
   - In each session, Maestro can automatically create a worktree for the feature branch
   - Use the worktree toggle in Auto Run to enable worktree mode
   - Each session gets its own isolated working directory

3. **Assign Tasks to Sessions**:
   - Session 1: Phase 1 (Setup) + User Story 1 tasks
   - Session 2: User Story 2 tasks (if independent)
   - Session 3: User Story 3 tasks (if independent)

4. **Merge When Complete**:
   - Each session commits to its feature branch
   - Use Maestro's git integration to merge branches
   - Or merge manually: `git merge session-branch`

### Worktree Commands

Maestro handles worktrees automatically, but for manual setup:

```bash
# Create a worktree for a feature branch
git worktree add ../my-feature-worktree feature-branch

# List existing worktrees
git worktree list

# Remove a worktree when done
git worktree remove ../my-feature-worktree
```

## Best Practices

1. **Complete Setup Phase First**: Always complete Phase 1 (Setup) before parallelizing user stories.

2. **Respect Dependencies**: Tasks without the `[P]` marker should run sequentially.

3. **Review Before Merging**: Use `/speckit.analyze` after implementation to verify consistency.

4. **Incremental Testing**: Each user story phase should be independently testable. Verify before moving to the next.

5. **Use Checklists**: If you created checklists with `/speckit.checklist`, verify them before marking the feature complete.

## Task Format Reference

Your `tasks.md` uses this format that Auto Run understands:

```markdown
- [ ] T001 Setup project structure
- [ ] T002 [P] Configure database connection
- [ ] T003 [P] [US1] Create User model in src/models/user.py
- [ ] T004 [US1] Implement UserService
```

- `- [ ]` = Incomplete task (Auto Run will process)
- `- [X]` = Completed task (Auto Run will skip)
- `[P]` = Parallelizable (can run with other [P] tasks)
- `[US1]` = User Story 1 (groups related tasks)

## Getting Help

- **View task progress**: Check the Auto Run panel in the Right Bar
- **See implementation details**: Each completed task includes notes about what was done
- **Troubleshoot issues**: Check the session logs in the main terminal view

## Next Steps After Implementation

1. Run `/speckit.analyze` to verify implementation consistency
2. Complete any remaining checklists
3. Run tests to ensure everything works
4. Create a pull request with your changes
