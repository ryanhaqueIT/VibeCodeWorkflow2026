Provide a brief synopsis of what you just accomplished in this task using this exact format:

**Summary:** [1-2 sentences describing the key outcome]

**Details:** [A paragraph with more specifics about what was done, files changed, etc.]

Rules:
- Be specific about what was actually accomplished, not what was attempted.
- Focus only on meaningful work that was done. Omit filler phrases like "the task is complete", "no further action needed", "everything is working", etc.
- If nothing meaningful was accomplished, respond with only: **Summary:** No changes made.
