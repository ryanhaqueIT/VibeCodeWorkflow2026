## Instructions

1. Project Orientation
    Begin by reviewing CLAUDE.md (when available) in this folder to understand the project's structure, conventions, and workflow expectations.

2. Task Selection
    Process the FIRST unchecked task (- [ ]) from top to bottom. Note that there may be relevant images associated with the task. If there are, analyze them, and include in your final synopsis back how many images you analyzed in preparation for solving the task.

    IMPORTANT: You will only work on this single task. If it appears to have logical subtasks, treat them as one cohesive unit—but do not move on to the next major item.

3. Task Evaluation
    - Fully understand the task and inspect the relevant code.
    - Determine which tasks you're going to work on in this run.
    - There will be future runs to take care of other tasks.
    - Your goal is to select enough items from the top of the unfinished list that make sense to work on within the same context window.

4. Task Implementation
    - Implement the task according to the project's established style, architecture, and coding norms.
    - Ensure that test cases are created, and that they pass.
    - Ensure you haven't broken any existing test cases.

5. Completion + Reporting
    - Mark the task as completed by changing "- [ ]" to "- [x]".
    - CRITICAL: Your FIRST sentence MUST be a specific synopsis of what you accomplished (e.g., "Added pagination to the user list component" or "Refactored auth middleware to use JWT tokens"). Never start with generic phrases like "Task completed successfully" - always lead with the specific work done.
    - Follow with any relevant details about:
      - Implementation approach or key decisions made
      - Why the task was intentionally skipped (if applicable)
      - If implementation failed, explain the failure and do NOT check off the item.

6. Version Control
    For any code or documentation changes, if we're in a Github repo:
    - Commit using a descriptive message prefixed with "MAESTRO: ".
    - Push to GitHub.
    - Update CLAUDE.md, README.md, or any other top-level documentation if appropriate.

7. Exit Immediately
    After completing (or skipping) your task, EXIT. Do not proceed to additional tasks—another agent instance will handle them. If there are no remaining open tasks, exit immediately and state that there is nothing left to do.
